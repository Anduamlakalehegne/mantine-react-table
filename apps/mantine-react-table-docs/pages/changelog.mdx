## Changelog

### V1

#### V1.0.0-beta.20

- Better TypeScript types to warn not to use other props alongside the `table` prop when passing to `<MantineReactTable />` (Either pass `table` or all table options as props, not both)
- Removed deprecated `tableInstanceRef` prop to force usage of `useMantineReactTable` hook (way less bugs, easier code)
- Added functionality to temporarily remove sort when global filter is ranking results, but restore the sort upon clearing the global filter
- New `mantineSelectCheckboxProps.variant` to allow for checkbox, radio, or switch select variants

#### V1.0.0-beta.19

- New `"custom"` editingMode that does not render any editing UI, but still handles the edit states
- New `isSaving` state option to show spinner in edit save buttons
- New `renderEditRowModalContent` table option to allow for the edit modal to be fully customized
- New `mantineEditRowModalProps` table option to allow for customizing the props of the edit modal
- Improved custom column actions with new `internalColumnMenuItems` param in `renderColumnActionsMenuItems` column/table option
- Fixed issues with empty string row ids causing skeleton loading rows to linger after data loaded and changed `getRowId` type to allow returning `undefined`
- Removed internal `withArrow` props from Mantine Tooltips to respect app themes better (Configure with Mantine ThemeProvider default Props API if you want them back)

- exported new `MRT_FlexRender` function as a utility to help with custom headless ui renders

#### V1.0.0-beta.16

#### V1.0.0-beta.10

#### V1.0.0-beta.10

#### V1.0.0-beta.9
